AI FIRST EXCHANGE — VERIFICATION SPECIFICATION (AIFX-VS)

Version 1.0 • 2025
Applies to: AIFM, AIFV, AIFI, AIFP Standards

1. Purpose of Verification

The purpose of the AIFX Verification System (AIFX-VS) is to establish graduated trust levels for AI-generated media by documenting declared provenance, creator identity signals, and metadata integrity.

This specification defines verification tiers, badge semantics, manifest fields, and validation rules for AI-native formats under the AI First Exchange (AIFX).

The Verification System supports:

Transparency of declared content origin

Integrity of embedded metadata

Identity signaling for creators

Ecosystem-wide trust indicators

Future compatibility with platform integrations

AIFX-VS does not assert absolute proof of origin beyond the documented creation workflow.

2. Verification Tiers
🟡 Tier 1 — Self-Declared Authenticity (SDA)

Badge: 🟡 SDA
Trust Level: Low

Requirements:

Creator manually enters metadata

No identity or email verification

No platform confirmation

Intended for:

Early-stage creators

Offline or experimental workflows

Basic format conversions

Manifest Fields Required:

"verification": {
  "trust_level": "self-declared",
  "method": "manual-entry",
  "verified_email": false,
  "platform_signal": false,
  "signature": null
}

🔵 Tier 2 — Verified Creator (VC)

Badge: 🔵 VC
Trust Level: Medium

Requirements:

Verified email address

Human-authorship statement signed

Optional OAuth authentication (GitHub, Google, etc.)

Cryptographic hash recorded in manifest

Intended for:

Professional creators

Monetized content

Portfolio and publishing workflows

Manifest Fields Required:

"verification": {
  "trust_level": "creator-verified",
  "method": "email-and-signature",
  "verified_email": true,
  "platform_signal": false,
  "signature": "sha256-hash"
}

🟢 Tier 3 — Platform Verified Authenticity (PVA)

Badge: 🟢 PVA
Trust Level: High

Requirements:

Metadata validated via trusted platform or pipeline signals

Prompt, model, and timestamp confirmation where supported

Optional cryptographic signing (future-compatible)

Intended for:

Platform-verified AI media

Enterprise or compliance-sensitive use cases

Legal-adjacent workflows

Manifest Fields Required:

"verification": {
  "trust_level": "platform-verified",
  "method": "platform-signal",
  "verified_email": true,
  "platform_signal": "suno | veo | runway | other",
  "signature": "base64-signature"
}


Platform verification depends on tool and API availability and does not imply universal support.

3. Verification Metadata Schema

All AIFX formats SHOULD include the following optional fields:

"verification_notes": "",
"reviewed_by": "",
"verification_version": "1.0"

4. Verification Workflows
🟡 Self-Declared Workflow

Creator enters metadata

Converter packages AIFX file

Manifest stored without signing

Badge assigned: SDA

🔵 Verified Creator Workflow

Creator authenticates

Email verified

Authorship statement signed

Signature hash recorded

Manifest updated

Badge assigned: VC

🟢 Platform Verified Workflow

Creator provides platform reference ID

Trusted signal or API metadata retrieved

Metadata validated

Optional digital signature verified

Manifest updated

Badge assigned: PVA

5. Badge Display Rules

SDA: Displayed universally, lowest ranking priority

VC: Displayed with creator identity; eligible for monetization

PVA: Displayed prominently; eligible for premium and enterprise contexts

Badges communicate trust tier, not creative quality.

6. Security & Anti-Fraud Considerations

Signed manifest fields MUST remain immutable

Hash-based signatures prevent silent tampering

Verification actions SHOULD be logged by converter tools

Blockchain anchoring MAY be supported in future versions

Fraudulent badge claims are grounds for revocation

7. Future Extensions (v2.0 Roadmap)

Public-key verification registry

Signature revocation system

Federated verification authorities

Optional blockchain timestamp anchoring

Cross-platform verification bridges

8. Compliance Statement

Implementations that fully adhere to this specification may display the:

AIFX Verification Mark (AVM)
Verification Specification v1.0

Non-compliant tools MUST NOT claim verification alignment or display AIFX badges.

9. Changelog

v1.0 — Initial Release

Defines SDA, VC, and PVA tiers

Establishes verification schema

Specifies badge semantics

Introduces integrity-first trust model

Aligns verification with AIFX standards
